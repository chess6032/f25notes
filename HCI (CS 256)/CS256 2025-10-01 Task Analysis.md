# Task Analysis Questions

We're going to go through the 11 task analysis questions and pretend to do a task analysis on a fictional "dream recorder" product.

(The dream recorder lets you play, analyze, share, and edit dreams&mdash;like videos. Interesting tasks: Review dreams, share clips with friends, censor embarrassing parts, auto-generate dream art.)

## 1. Who is going to use the system?

- Identity.
    - You need several typical users.
- Background/skills.
- Values, likes/dislikes.
- Personal characteristics.
    - Education
    - Literacy
        - Designing for children is very diff than designing for college-aged users.
    - Physical abilities/disabilities
        - Some physical traits may be relevant in your ability to do different types of tasks, e.g. height, weight.
    - Age
    - etc.

Finding out the answer to this questions is a matter of observation. Go out and find who uses the thing you are replacing.

This question is (one place) where personas come in a lot.

## 2. What tasks do they now perform? 3. What tasks are desired?

- Find some real users.
- Talk to them.
    - Find out what they do now.
    - How would you fit your system in?



### Old & New Tasks

- Old
    - The way people do things now.
- New
    - The way you anticipate them doing things in the future.
- Observe!
    - Pick the most important tasks.
    - Remember, you're guessing about future tasks.
    - Return to this when you test your prototypes.

### Example: Online billing in a dental office

Dental office had billing automated. Designers scanned in the old, hand-written billing system and digitized it. But assistants hated it. It turns out when it was hand-written, the assistants would include notes about patients in the margins (e.g. "Patient A's insurance takes longer to process than normal."), and there was no way to do this in the new, digital system.

## 4. How are the tasks learned?

*Aside: Sometimes, not every question in this list is relevant to what you're building. The list is meant to serve as a comprehensive set of questions that you can consider to tackle your product from different angles.*

- What does the user need to know?
- Do they need training?
    - Book/manual info
    - General knowledge/skills
    - Special instruction/training
- Experience, level of education and literacy.
    - **8th grade is often reasonable in borad design contexts.**

## 5. Where are the tasks performed?

Consider:

- Where.
    - Office?
    - Lab?
    - Retail?
    - On-the-go?
    - Home?
- Effects of environment on users?
    - Lighting.
    - Sound.
        - An app for football game attendees is a very loud, distracting environment.
    - Comfort.
        - e.g. apps for 
    - Interruptions.
- Social influence of environment.
    - Rituals.
    - Sacred places.
        - An app designed to be used in sacrament meeting would have its own considerations.
    - Peer pressure & power dynamics.
        - e.g. between therapist & patient.
- Effects of other people (bystanders)?
    - Privacy issues?
    - Safety issues?

## 6. What is the relationship btwn user & data?

This is becoming more and more important to think about.

What kinds of data are you creating, and how does that relate to your user?

- Personal data
    - What personal data are you collecting?
    - Privacy
        - Always accessed at the same machine?
        - Do users move between machines?
- Common data
    - Handling & processing
        - Used concurrently?
        - Passed sequentially btwn users?
- Is remote access required?
- Is access to data restricted?

## 7. What other tools does the user have?

- Users 
    - Mobile phone
    - Laptop, PC
    - Tablet device
    - Smart watch
    - Fitness tracker
    - Maps
- Can we use other tools to facilitate interaction?
    - e.g: if they're active on social media, would they want to incorporate that?

It's about finding ways to fit in with the user's existing ecosystem.

## 8. How do users communicate with each other?

- Whose communicating to who?
- About what?
- Does it follow communication lines of the organization, or does it go against it?
    - e.g. assistant to manager
        - Installation of computers changes communication btwn them.
            - Your boss now has access to communicate with you 24/7.
        - People would rather change their computer usage than their relationship.
    - Changing the ways people communicate can create some interesting shifts.

## 9. How often are the tasks performed?

- Frequent users remember more details.
- Infrequent users may need more help.
    - BUT don't make it tedious.
        - Don't make them feel like a child.
- Which function is performed most frequently? By which customers?
    - Optimizing the system for tasks used more frequently will improve perception of good performance.

## 10. What are the time constraints of the tasks?

- What functions will customers be in a hurry for?
    - e.g. in a ticket purchasing app, people will be trying to buy tickets as soon as they're available.
- What functions can wait?
- Is there a timing relationship between tasks?
    - What tasks depend on the timing of other tasks?
    - e.g. you can't share anything you haven't created yet.

## 11. What happens when things go wrong?

- How do people deal with...
    - ...Errors?
    - ...Practical difficulties?
    - ...Catastrophies?
        - It's easy to get carried away with this one imagining every possible thing that could go wrong.
- Is there a backup strategy?

# Task analysis in design

## Using tasks in design

- Write up a description of the tasks.
- Produce scenarios or a storybosard covering atsks.
- Rough out an interface design.

Hughes had some examples of how the task analysis questions from above feeds into design...but she didn't have time in class to show us. (Tragic, truly.)
