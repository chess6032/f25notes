# Color

## Human Vision

- Our retina has cones that detect frequencies. But they don't all have the same sensitivity.
- Vision is optimized for edges, not brightness.
- Dsicriminability of colors depends on how they are presented.
    - Between pale colors, it's harder to distinguish different hues.
    - Size of color plays a role in how well you can distinguish colors.
        - Important for text, which has low size. 
    - Colors presented far apart are harder to distinguish than one close up.

## Color Blindness

- Many different types.
- A good, quick way to test if your design is color blind friendly is to grayscale a screenshot of your design and see if colors are still distinguishable in your design.
- Don't rely on just color.
    - Use other signifiers as well.

## Purposes of Color

###  1. Attention
- If you blur an image of your design, where does your eye go?
    - When there's a lot of detail on your design, it can be hard to tell how specifically color is impacting your design. So doing this helps with that. 
 Mood

#### HSV Color Model

- Good text contrast uses value instead of hue. 
- Avoid contrast only in hue.
- Be careful about high saturation colors.
    - They're very loud, and oft you don't want that type of asthetic in your design.

#### EZ way for good results

- White
- Black
- Key color (common), w/ lighter and a darker versions.
- Accent color (rare), w/ high contrast to key color.

#### Gradients

Be careful with gradients.


### 2. Mood

You can use the blurring technique to guage a design's mood as well.

- Emotion
- Age
- Energy
- Gender

The goal is to make a lo-fi prototype that implements the tasks your're identifying for Investigation 5 that form  your MVP.
