# Olsen's Principles of Spatial Design

- Visual search.
    - Macula/Periphery.
        - Our peripheral vision is pretty fuzzy, but we still use that info a lot.
- Scanning.
    - Reading scan order.
    - Hierarching scan.
    - White space.
- Layout.
    - Grid systems.
    - Balance.
        - We go INSANE if things are unbalanced.
    - Rhythm.
        - We look for order & patterns in things.
- Consistency.
    - Logical layout.
    - Consistent use of imagery.
    - Font choices.
        - Don't use a ton of different fonts.
        - Use consistent fonts across interfaces.
- Simplicity (e.g., Google.)

# Desigining w/ the Mind

## Our perception is biased.

- Gestalt Principle: Proximity.
    - Things that belong together are close to each other.

## Visual Hierarchy

- Visual hierarchy.
    - Visual hierarchy gets people to their goal faster.
    - Size
        - Bigger things are seen first.
    - Prominence
        - Put most important content/info in the most prominent position.
        - Higher up page == more prominent.
    - Content relationships
        - Group similar content types by displaying the content in a similar visual style, or in a clearly defined area.
