# Enums

Enums are classes...what???

The `ordinal` method on the enum class converts it to a number.

# Design Principle #1: Encapsulation

Encapsulation: Hiding the details.

## Why use encapsulation?

Problems oft arise when someone can directly access the inside of a class.

### Hiding stuff

Encapsulation is a tool you use to make sure a class is only used in the ways you intend it.

By default, hide stuff. Do not share anything unless you have an absolute proven use case to share it. (Be like the NSA.)

One of the guys who popularized OOP said: Once you release a class into the wild, you no longer own it. It will be used in ways you never intended.

(By default, Java variables & methods are "package" visibility, meaning by default they're visible to anything in your package.)

### Convenience

#### Example

```java
public class GetSetExample {
    public int[] scores = new int[10];
}
```

This is great...but what if you want to change how `scores` works?

So let's do this:

```java
public class GetSetExample {
    public int[] getScores() {
        return scores;
    }

    public void setScores(int[] scores) {
        this.scores = scores;
    }

    private int[] scores = new int[10];
}
```

This allows you to, say, store the scores in a different data structure. That won't matter. 

<!-- ```java
public class GetSetExample {
    public int[] getScores() {
        int[] copy = new int[scores.length];
        System.arraycopy(scores, 0, copy, 0, scores.length);s
        return copy;
    }

    public void setScores(int[] scores) {
        for (var i = 0; i < scores.length; ++i) {

        }
    }

    private int[] scores = new int[10];
}

``` -->

# Object class

## Methods

Commonly overwritten:

- `toString` &mdash; String
- `equals` &mdash; bool
- `hashCode` &mdash; int
- `clone` &mdash; Object

Almost never overwritten:

- `wait`
- `notify`
- `getClass`

### toString

Returns string.

### equals

**Never use `==` to compare objects.** `==` compares the data stored in memory, and returns true if it's the same. That works great for primitives, but NOT for objects.

#### Example

```java
public class EqualExample {

private String value;

public EqualExample(String value) { this.value = value; } // constructor

@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; // check that o is neither null nor a different class.
    EqualExample that = (EqualExample) o; // we know o is the same class, so we can type-cast o.
    return value.equals(that.value); // compare values of objects. (Kinda cheating lowk.)
    // he mentioned smth ab that last line working bc value is CLASS private (not OBJECT private)...whatever that means?
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    var o1 = new EqualExample("taco");
    var 02 = new EqualExample("taco");
    var 03 = new EqualExample("fish");

    System.out.println(o1 == o2);       // returns FALSE
    System.out.println(o2 == o2);       // returns TRUE
    System.out.println(o1.equals(o1));  // returns TRUE
    System.out.println(o1.equals(o2));  // returns TRUE
    System.out.println(o1.equals(o3));  // returns FLASE
}

}
```

Aside: There's nothing special about `that`, it's just oft used.

### Hashcode

Typically done by getting the properties of a class, getting their hashcode, and multiplying it by a prime number.

If two objects' hashcodes are the same, that means they *might* be the same. 

# Records

Making a bunch of get/set functions gets old fast. Lots and lots of boilerplate code.

So, the gods of Java listened, and created records.

```java
record PetRecord(int id, String name, String type) {}
```

Records are syntactic sugar. Idk exactly how tf they work.

# Design principle #2: Immutability

"Immutability" = Cannot change.

"Immutable objects are simple. They are safe to share and publish freely without the need to make defensive copies." -- Brian Goetz 

Helps make your life easier. Especially during multi-threaded programming.

**If you can make something immutable, make it immutable.**

# Misc

## `extends`

You'll find the `extends` keyword used when classes are declared. It is used for **inheritency**.

By default, everything extends from a central `Object` class.

## `@`

Stuff starting w/ `@` is just giving extra information, typically for the IDE. 

e.g. `@Override` placed on the line before the declaration of a method overriding a parent class's method.

These don't affect the code itself. You can remove them without anything happening.

## `final`

The `final` keyword, placed when declaring variables, indicates that the variable is constant. (I think????)
