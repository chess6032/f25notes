*Paradise Lost books 3 & 4 (and 6?)*  

# Character analysis

## God

- God is personified perhaps a lot more than was common at the time.
    - And yet, at the same time, He is still deified, invisible.

## Satan

- Satan is embodiment of Hell. It is within him and without him. 
- Changes we see in Satan:
    - Satan changes shape into a bird, a lion/tiger, others. 
        - When he whispers into Eve's ear for the first time, he's a toad.
            - In contrast, in the first book, he was described physically as very big and impressive. So he's dwindling physically as his power dwindles.
- Foil of the Son:
    - The Son volunteers to leave Heaven; Satan volunteers to leave Hell.
    - The Son is unchanging, Satan is changing.

## Adam

Awkward I wasn't paying attention, I was texting Sage.

## Eve

- Characterized as beautiful, graceful, submissive. 
    - But at the same time, seems to be the point of confusion/commotion for Adam when he starts to waver to temptation/moral deviation.
        - (seen later in Book 8)
        - Satan whispers in Eve's ear first.
        - In this way, it seems Milton is setting her up to be the scapegoat for the fall.

## The Son
