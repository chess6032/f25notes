- Code of behavior
    - Thinking less ab afterlife.
    - Human action not judged in terms of right/wrong or good/evil.
    - Present, concret validity & effectiveness.

"The Renaisance assumption is that there are things here on Earth that are highlly worh doing, and that by doing them, humanity proves its prviliged position ...and do God's intent." (or smth like that was written on the slides.)


### Art

Art's focus is on realism. As for subjects, it's about the individual and their relationship to God and the world around them.  

## Questions ab the Ren

- What made the Ren start?
- What did the authors' lives look like?

    - How do ideas grow

- One student said: Rene Descarte emphasized the conquering himself (humanism). 
    - Third maxim.
    - "Except my own thoughts, there is nothing in my power." &mdash; Ren through-and-through.








OK I kinda zoned out for like the rest of class. But somewhere in the discussion, someone talked ab how we expect people to act how we would expect ourselves to act, rather than letting them express their own views & temperament. Prof drew on that noting how she always took issue with the Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would want done unto you"...but maybe that's not how they want done unto them!

Another student somewhere in the discussion noted how we should still look to God for wisdom&mdash;not just our own thoughts&mdash;but that it's still amazing how God empowers us to look for wisdom ourselves. (idk he said it better.)
