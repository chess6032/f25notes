# Tempest Discussion

Prospero's Character:

- Compassion for honest G.
- Sees love btwn daughter & F. &rarr; change
    - This was the **turning point** for his character.
- Pre-G: 
    - Descriptors
        - Vengeful
        - Cynical
        - Power hungry
        - Jealous
        - Close-minded
    - Actions (that evident those descriptors)
        - Schemes a lot (a LOT a lot).
        - Heavily relied on his magic.
        - Caused fear.
        - Targeted individuals. 
            - Torturing & sending spirits all over.
        - That said, one student pointed out, he told the spirit from the beginning that he'd free them.
            - But you can def tell that after the wedding, everything in the plot seems resolved...frankly in a pretty convenient way. (Everything works out p nice.)

## Musical Discussion

### Power/Justice/Manipuliation

- Power for ill
- Question: Did Prospero give up his magical power to be the rightful Duke, or did he give up his magical power now that he has political power as the Duke?
    - It's hard to give up power once you have it.
    - Last line of *The Tempest*: "Mercy itself frees all faults. As you from crimes pardoned be. Let your indulgence set me free." ("God frees from.")
        - Student who quoted this said that this reads as Prospero moving on.
        - "your" == audience.
            - Is *he* even free, as a character in a play, being observed?

### Rationality vs. Magic

- Insight: Vengence correlates to magic, forgiveness correlates to not magic. 
    - When he's vengeful in his life is when he's focused on his magic. But when he decides to forgive is when he decides to let go of his magic.
    - He only turns to magic when he loses his Dukedom. He turns to magic to fulfill that power vacuum.
        - Maybe that was his plan from the beginning&mdash;to use the magic as a tool to get back to where he was before?
            - Power as human need.
- Question: Relationship to church & magic/religion?

### Storm

- Insight: Dichotomy of control vs. chaos.
    - To Prospero: It's all controled.
    - To everyone else: Perceive it as pure chaos and terrible thing happening (that shouldn't be).
- Question: How have you seen this in y'all's lives?
    - When have you perceived something as chaos at first, but in hindsight it felt logical/"controlled"? 
- Teacher noted that Prospero, in giving up his magic (I think that's what she tied it to, maybe it was smth else idk), had to give up some of his control.

### idk what this topic was

- Insight: Wedding is turning point. Other turning point: Pg. 52, talking to Ferdinand: If I've punished you, your compensation makes ammends..."My trials of love." After that, it's uphill.

### Miranda

- Insight: 
    - Pondering "How do their perspectives differ" reminded student of *Tangled*: Rapunzel vs. Gothel. 
        - Gothel: Cynical, just wants power for herself.
        - Rapunzel (Miranda): Trusting, perhaps naive (doesn't know evil in world).
    - Noticed as Miranda is the only woman in *The Tempest*, she doesn't have her own character arc, & lacks depth. 
        - Hence, characteristics she embodies (hopefulness, innocence, going with the situation, wants the best for everyone) represents the ideal for a Renaissance woman.
            - Don't want a woman like Prospero.
- Question: Does Miranda reflect the ideal of a Renaissance woman, as a character that supports the men's character arcs & plotlines (as opposed to having her own)?
- Idealistic about getting married. Very trusting, doesn't see some of the things her dad does.

### How did reading a second time impact experience?

- Insight: 
    - Each of students in group were looking for smth specific when they read it (writing style, heroic characteristics, etc.). Reading a second time w/ the culture & background completely changed how they read it. 
        - When looking for different things, you find different things (in the same reading).
- Question:
    - How did reading *The Tempest* in the context of *this* class affect how you read it?
    - How would your perspective of *The Tempest* be different if you read the play with a different purpose/in a different context?
- Text:
    - Act 2, Scene 2, line 75 (pg 37): Changes one master for another.
        - Maybe if I get a second master, they can get rid of the master that has power over me currently. Were they intending to end up completely free, or just find a more preferable servitude?

### Misc stuff people found interesting

- "Let your indulgence set me free" was the last thing Shakespeare ever wrote by himself.
    - Lots of people see this as Shakespeare's farewell/"Swan song".
- "Hell is empty and all the devils are here."
    - Prof said a turning point for Prospero was Ariel. (Act 5, Scene 1, very beginning.)
        - "PROSPERO: Where are my man? ARIEL: They're bound together in the same fashion you gave charge. But chiefly, he that you turned, sir, Gonzalo his tears ran down his beard...if you now beheld them your affections would become tender."
